my Automate the Boring Stuff with Python projects

You can run the files by downloading them off the wiki (above. next to code, issues, pull requests, etc.),
or just by copying the code shown when you click the file and pasting in into your editor so you can run it on ur pc.

You can also download them with command prompt or by forking it, but if u dont know how to do that u dont need to.
